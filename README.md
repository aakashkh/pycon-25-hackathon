# 🎯 Intelligent Support Ticket Assignment System

**PyCon25 Hackathon Submission**

An advanced AI-powered system that intelligently routes support tickets to the most suitable agents based on skill matching, priority analysis, and workload optimization.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Run the assignment system
python ticket_assignment_system.py

# Output will be generated in output_result.json
```

## 📋 Project Overview

### Problem Statement
In helpdesk systems, optimal ticket routing is crucial for:
- **Maximum Resolution Likelihood**: Matching tickets to skilled agents
- **Fair Workload Distribution**: Balancing assignments across team
- **Priority Handling**: Ensuring critical issues get immediate attention
- **Scalable Operations**: Efficient processing of large ticket volumes

### Solution Approach
Our system uses a **multi-factor scoring algorithm** that combines:

1. **🎯 Skill Matching (40% weight)**: NLP-based text analysis to identify required skills
2. **⚡ Priority Scoring (25% weight)**: Urgency detection using keyword analysis
3. **⚖️ Load Balancing (20% weight)**: Dynamic workload distribution
4. **🏆 Experience Factor (15% weight)**: Agent experience and availability

## 🧠 Algorithm Details

### Skill Extraction Engine
- **44 predefined skill categories** mapped to domain-specific keywords
- **Intelligent text parsing** of ticket titles and descriptions
- **Multi-skill detection** for complex issues

### Priority Classification
```
Priority 10 (Critical): System outages, security breaches, hardware failures
Priority 8 (High):      Performance issues, access problems, malware
Priority 6 (Medium):    Configuration issues, permissions
Priority 2 (Low):       Standard requests, licenses, routine tasks
```

### Scoring Formula
```
Total Score = Skill_Match_Score + Experience_Score + Workload_Score + Availability_Bonus + Priority_Bonus

Where:
- Skill_Match_Score = Average(relevant_skills) * 10     [0-100]
- Experience_Score = min(experience_level * 1.5, 20)   [0-20]
- Workload_Score = (5 - current_load) * 6              [0-30]
- Availability_Bonus = 10 if available else 0          [0-10]
- Priority_Bonus = priority * 0.5 if priority >= 8     [0-5]
```

## 📊 Performance Results

### Assignment Distribution
```
agent_001 (Sarah Chen):      2 -> 11 tickets  (+9)   - Networking Expert
agent_002 (Alex Rodriguez):  4 -> 29 tickets  (+25)  - AD/Windows Specialist  
agent_003 (Michael Lee):     3 -> 15 tickets  (+12)  - Security/Database
agent_004 (Jessica Williams): 1 -> 11 tickets (+10)  - M365/SharePoint
agent_005 (David Gupta):     2 -> 5 tickets   (+3)   - Azure/DevOps
agent_006 (Emily Johnson):   3 -> 27 tickets  (+24)  - Hardware Specialist
agent_007 (Chris Davis):     4 -> 7 tickets   (+3)   - VoIP/Network
agent_008 (Laura Martinez):  2 -> 11 tickets  (+9)   - Security/Malware
agent_009 (James Brown):     1 -> 4 tickets   (+3)   - Database/Analytics
agent_010 (Michelle Kim):    3 -> 5 tickets   (+2)   - Web/API
```

### Priority Handling
- **Critical (Priority 10)**: 42 tickets - Assigned to most experienced agents
- **High (Priority 8)**: 31 tickets - Balanced between skill and experience
- **Medium (Priority 6)**: 4 tickets - Optimized for efficiency
- **Low (Priority 2-5)**: 23 tickets - Distributed based on availability
